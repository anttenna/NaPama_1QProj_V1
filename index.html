    <p id="para">AI has a caused a lot of problems like taking people(artists) jobs and having a negative impact on the environment. AI need's lots of water to cool down which distrupts local ecosystems and puts pressure on muncipial water supplies. AI also takes lots of electricity in order to function which leads to an increase in carbon dioxide emissions and pressure on the electricity grid. </p>
    <p id="para">AI "art" generates based on artists' work without their consent.  AI tries mimicking human creaticity by scrapping artists work without consent and sometimes being able to mimic their(artists) artstyle. Since AI is a free resource and can generate "art" it causes artists to lose their jobs and be replaced by AI to lower costs.</p>
    <p id="para">Heres the statistics of artists losing their jobs to AI:</p>
    <table class="table" id="para">
        <tr class="table">
            <th class="table">local</th>
            <th class="table">international</th>
        </tr>
        <tr class="table">
            <td class="table">17%</td>
            <td class="table">26%</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <div id="para2">
    <p id="para2">As of right now in the Philippines, there are laws being worked on about the use of AI in artists' works and some existing laws that prevent people losing their jobs or their pay getting decreased. Not just in the Philippines, but on the internet lots of people are helping spread awareness of the bad effects of using generative AI. Tools made to prevent art from being scrapped is available online and prevent AI from stealing artists works without consent. </p>
    <br id="para2">
    <p id="para2">We come in to help inform people about the effects caused by AI and how to spot AI. First, we plan on informing more people about the effects of AI on the environment as most of the time the only people who are informed about AI's effects on our environments are artists or people who hang out in artist spaces. Next, we would like too inform people how to spot AI. Teaching people of what inconsistencies usually show up in AI art as most people have difficulty identifying AI "art" from art made by an artist.</p>
