    <h1>ABOUT US >:DD</h1>
    <p> We as an advocacy group are people motivated in informing others about the bad effects of AI. As artists, we want to make sure that people know the difference between AI art and real art as AI has inconsistencies that are almost always present.
        We are concious about how AI negatively effects the environment and out of concern want to inform people about it.
    </p>
    <p>We had a rough start not knowing which direction to start in. We eventually decided to that we would talk about the negative effects of AI and how to help people spot AI. After much considerations we also decided to add a few ways to avoid getting your art scrapped for AI or poison AI databases using applications made just for that.
        We continued pushing on giving it our all and thats how we ended up here today. </p>

    <p>I am Athena Gabrielle Pama. I am an artist and I love drawing. I dislike AI being used for art as that is something that can be learnt and takes practice.
